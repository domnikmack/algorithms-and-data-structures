# Breadth First Traversal
## Time and Space Complexity
Time: O(v + e)<br>
*v = vertices, e = edges*<br>

Space: O(v)<br>
*THe number of values being stored in an output array is the bigger number.<br>
Nodes/vertices are stored in array as well but this number is smaller and therefore it's disregarded.*
