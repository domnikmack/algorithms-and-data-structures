# Invert Binary Search Tree
## Iterative Solution Time and Space Complexity
Time: O(n)</br>
Space: O(n)<br/>
*(Most space used in a perfect binary tree: all leave nodes.<br/>
That's roughly half of all nodes = n / 2 i.e. **n**.*

## Recursive Solution
Time: O(n)</br>
Space: O(h)</br>
*h = height of tree</br>
h = log(n) so you could also say O(log(n)*
