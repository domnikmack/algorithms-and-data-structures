# Find Closest Value BST
## Time and Space Complexity
### Iterative Solution
Time:
  Average: O(log(n))<br />
  Worst case: O(n) (if tree is a linked list)<br />
*n = being the number of nodes*

Space: O(1)<br />
*constant, we are only storing the current closest value.*

### Recursive Solution
Time:
  Average: O(log(n))<br />
  Worst case: O(n)<br />
*same as iterative solution*

Space:
  Average: O(log(n))<br />
  Worst case: O(n)<br />
*corresponds to number of frames in call stack*
