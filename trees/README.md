# Trees
## Overview
### Definition of a Tree
* data structure
* consists of nodes with a value and references to other nodes (child nodes)
* often used to simulate hierarchical tree structure
* could also be defined as a acyclic graph with N nodes and N - 1 edges

### Binary Tree
* one of the most common trees
* each node can have a max for 2 child nodes

### Traversing a Tree
#### Pre-order Traversal
* root
* left sub-tree
* right sub-tree

#### In-order Traversal
* left sub-tree
* root
* right sub-tree

*In case of a binary search tree: data can be traversed in sorted order by in-order traveral.*

#### Post-order Traversal
* left subtree
* right subtree
* root

All tree traversals can be done iteratively or recursively.
