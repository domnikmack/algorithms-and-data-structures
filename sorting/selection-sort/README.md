# Selection Sort
## Concept
* split array in 2 sections
* left is sorted, initialize with length = 0
* right is unsorted
* initialize an index at 0 to be first index of sorted part
* iterate through righ, finding index of lowest number
* swap lowest number of right with first number of left
* increment index
* repeat

## Time and Space Complexity
Time: O(n^2)<br />
Space: O(1)<br />
